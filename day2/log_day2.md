# Day 2 – Reflection

## What I built:
- Functions (simple + return)
- Nested loops (12 pattern exercises)
- Task Tracker console app

## What was easy:
- Loop logic
- Writing functions
- Printing patterns

## What was confusing:
- Some nested loop variations
- Remembering which exercise was next

## What I improved:
- Clearer logic thinking
- Understanding loops deeply
- Managing a multi-file Python project

## What I want to improve tomorrow (Day 3):
- File handling
- Saving/loading data
- Using modules
