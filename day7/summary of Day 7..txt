DAY 7 — The Merger: Connecting API to Database

🎯 Goal Connect the "Brain" (FastAPI) to the "Memory" (SQL Database) so that data survives server restarts.

🔹 Key Concepts Learned

The Request-Response Lifecycle: We open a database connection for each request and close it immediately after.

Dependency Injection (Depends): The "Butler" pattern. We use a function (get_session) to hand the database connection to our API endpoints automatically.

Lifespan Events: How to run startup code (like creating tables) automatically when the server launches.

🔹 Code Accomplishments

Created day7_app.py combining FastAPI and SQLModel.

Built the get_session generator with yield to safely manage connections.

Refactored POST to save to disk (session.add, session.commit).

Refactored GET to read from disk (session.exec, select).
